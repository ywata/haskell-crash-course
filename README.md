The aim of this crash course is to learn important concepts of Haskell very quickly.

Self-studying Haskell is somewhat hard in the begging.<br />
This material is intended to resolve the issue solving some excercises with the help of an intermediate Haskeller.

After you finish this material with your tutor, you'll experience the productivity and fun of Haskell.

## Contents

In this material, the author plants to cover basic functionality of Haskell, which includes the following:

### Tool

* REPL
* Literate programming

### Language

* Types
    * ADT (Abstract Data Type)
    * Pattern match
    * Compile error (~= type error)
	* Recursive data type
	* Type class
* Functions
    * Recursive function
    * Composition of functions and higher order functions
* IO
* Unit Tests


As type and functions are interrelated, the order of the subjects presented is different from the above.
Inteded order of presentation is described in src/Main.lhs.
