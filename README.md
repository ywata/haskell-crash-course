The aim of this crash course is to learn important concepts of Haskell very quickly.
Because self studying Haskell is somewhat hard in the begging,
this material is intended to resolve the issue solving some excercises with a intermediate Haskeller.
After you finish this material with your tutor, you'll experience productivity of Haskell and fun.

In this material, the author plants to cover basic functionality of Haskell.
That should cover:
* Tool
- REPL
- Literate programming

* Language
- Type
 - ADT(Abstract Data Type)
 - Pattern match
 - Compile error(~= type error)
- Function
 - Recursive function
 - Composition of functions and higher order functions
- Unit Test
- IO

As type and functions are interrelated, the order of the subjects presented is different from
the above.
